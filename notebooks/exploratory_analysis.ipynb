    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**1️⃣ Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to **enhance transparency and accountability in political financing in Kenya ahead of the 2027 elections.**\n",
    "\n",
    "By monitoring, visualizing, and analyzing campaign finance data, the tool will provide early warnings of potential corruption, excessive concentration of funding, and irregular expenditure patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This empowers citizens, journalists, political oversight bodies, and civil society to hold political parties and candidates accountable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2️⃣ Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Political financing in Kenya faces significant challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opacity: Lack of clarity on who funds parties and candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Corruption risk: Secretive or disproportionate funding creates undue influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regulatory gaps: Existing laws (Political Parties Act 2011, Elections Campaign Finance Act 2013) are poorly enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public disengagement: Citizens cannot easily interpret campaign funding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These gaps undermine the integrity of electoral processes and threaten democratic accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3️⃣ Opportunity / Value Proposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "By building an interactive dashboard and risk monitoring system, the project will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expose illicit or unusual campaign financing through visualizations and early warning indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Promote informed public discourse with clear, interpretable metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support oversight institutions (TI-Kenya, IEBC, civil society) with actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encourage compliance by increasing visibility of donations, party fund allocations, and campaign spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: we turn political finance data into actionable intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4️⃣ Scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Political party donations and campaign expenditures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Donor concentration and high-value contributors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporal patterns and expenditure spikes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regional distribution of campaign funds\n",
    "\n",
    "- Risk scoring for irregular funding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of Scope (for hackathon):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Legal enforcement or intervention\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-time integration with IEBC internal systems (demo only)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting election outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "**5️⃣ Target Users**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Civil society and NGOs (e.g., TI-Kenya, URAI Trust) for oversight\n",
    "\n",
    "- Journalists reporting on political financing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Citizens interested in election integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Policy makers / regulators who need early warnings on irregularities\n",
    "\n",
    "**6️⃣ Success Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functional dashboard with interactive visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accurate detection of anomalies (spending spikes, donor concentration)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear risk indicators for irregularities\n",
    "\n",
    "- User-friendly interface for non-technical stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "- Judges/mentors can understand patterns without heavy explanation"
